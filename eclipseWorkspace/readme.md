This directory is where you keep your projects.

To add a project:
  copy the SlickLibSetup project, and name it what you want. It already has
  all of the necessary settings to make the application work with the installed
  libraries. Then, in eclipse, go to File->Import->General->Existing Project and import the project into your workspace.
  
NOTE: the Slick2D and lwjgl libraries are stored in the ExternalLibs project. This project should not be changed unless
      libraries are being changed.
